Marley was dead: to begin with.

There is no doubt whatever about that.
The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for the anything he chose to put his hand to.

Old Marley was as dead as door-nail.
